**LLM Llam Project: Job Page Email Generator**
=====================================================

**Overview**
------------

This project utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a tailored email to a hiring manager based on a provided job page. The goal is to assist job seekers in crafting a compelling email that highlights their relevant skills and experience, increasing their chances of getting noticed by the hiring manager.

**Features**
------------

* **Job Page Analysis**: The model analyzes the job page to extract key information such as job title, company, required skills, and responsibilities.
* **Email Generation**: Based on the analyzed information, the model generates a well-structured email that includes:
	+ A personalized greeting
	+ A brief introduction highlighting relevant skills and experience
	+ A summary of how the candidate's skills align with the job requirements
	+ A call-to-action (CTA) to schedule an interview
* **Customization**: Users can input their own information, such as their name, email address, and LinkedIn profile (optional), to personalize the generated email.

**Requirements**
---------------

* **Python 3.8+**: The project is built using Python 3.8 and later versions.
